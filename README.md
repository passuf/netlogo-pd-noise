# Prisoner's Dilemma with Noise

This is an extended version of the [PD N-Person Iterated](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/PDN-PersonIterated) NetLogo model from the official NetLogo Models Library with a focus on noise. In addition to the original model there are several more noise resistant strategies implemented and the ability to choose different types of noise.

For more details about the original model take a look at [INFO.md](INFO.md).
